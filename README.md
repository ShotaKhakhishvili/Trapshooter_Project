This is how I begun making Trapshooter.

This repository Only contains first 3 update(valid ones).
All the updates are valid (project is runnable on UE5.1) before one called "Update 2.1".
After that the project had issues with memory so I stopped uploading on github, and instead I save all the project update's built content on my computer.
